Idea is pretty simple: Take screenshots of your screen send it to an LLM and get responses based on what it sees. Objective is to replicate a certain Application. Trying to recreate Cluely to understand how to tear it apart :!!!!!
working on linking it up with ollama for you open source baddies. (P.S. A better looking ReadME file will be written soon. I am a little caught up working on the project :))

IT WORKS!!!!! AUDIO FEATURES ARE A BIT UNRELIABLE RIGHT NOW BUT IT WORKS.

CURRENT TECH STACK:
Electron and Node Js for frontend
Python+ Flask API Backend
Crew AI
Gemini API
RealTimeSTT and RealTimeTTS + Whisper Models
Working on Ollama Integration- Preferably the main focus of the project in the future

General Idea: Works entirely on opensourced models and frameworks. You dont spend a penny on any of the multimodal features and everything is driven on a system prompt you set!
The gemini integration is a plus in case you need that extra juice but right now in testing I am sticking with gemini for reliability and lack of computing resources.
